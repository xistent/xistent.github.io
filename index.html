        <p>A leaf is an organ of a vascular plant and is the principal lateral appendage of the stem. The leaves and

        <p>The type of leaf is usually characteristic of a species (monomorphic), although some species produce more
            than one type of leaf. Some basic types of leaf are</p>
        <b>Fern</b>
        <p>A fern is a member of a group of vascular plants that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor
            flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular, i.e., having specialized tissues that conduct water and
            nutrients</p>
        <b>Conifers</b>
        <p>Conifers are a division of vascular land plants containing a single extant class, Pinopsida. They are
            gymnosperms, cone-bearing seed plants. All extant conifers are perennial woody plants with secondary
            growth. The great majority are trees, though a few are shrubs. Examples include cedars, Douglas firs, etc.</p>
        <b>angiospermae</b>
        <p>Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approximately
            13,164 known genera and c. 369,000 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants.</p>
